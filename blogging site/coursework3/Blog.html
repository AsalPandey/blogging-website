                <b><h1 align="center"> Impact Of Technology on Our Daily Lives.</h1></b>
                
                <br>
                <p>we have come so far in the mordern days that technologies are our both arms and legs. We’re living in the era of advanced technology which has allowed us to live a life with ease.Technology plays an important role in society today. Earth has become a global vilage.we can communicate with anyone,anywhere with just a few clicks of buttons. machines wash our clothes and cooks our food and many more.they have become part of our daily lives </p>
                <br>
                <p>Technology has been a part of our lives such that we can’t survive without. It helps us to write documents, like the one you’re reading to right now. almost every work or tasks involves some kind of technologies nwdays, whether it is a computer or a simple lever. It has made our lives so much  much easier.

                    <span id="remainingText">  We can book hotels, read books, order foods with just a click. We can travel all around the world without using any physical maps. From GPS we can track where we are and even where our children are. with internet, we have access global information and find knowledge on almost anything. We can communicate with people living next corner of the world and so much more<br><br><br><br>

                        with all the postive sides with technological advances, there’s a downside to it all. we are being too much dependent upon technology that we have become idle and lazy, and  We are loosing our creativity and physical strengths slowely with time.we are being dependent upon technologies for even small things too. some might even argue that we are de-evolving slowley with time.
